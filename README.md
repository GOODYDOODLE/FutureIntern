House Price Prediction Using Linear Regression
Overview
This project aims to predict house prices using a linear regression model. By analyzing various features of houses, such as size, number of rooms, location, etc., we can estimate the market price of a house.

Introduction
In this project, we build a linear regression model to predict house prices. Linear regression is a statistical method that models the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. This project provides a comprehensive walkthrough, from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Boston Housing Dataset. It contains information about various houses in Boston, such as:

CRIM: Crime rate by town

ZN: Proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq. ft.

INDUS: Proportion of non-retail business acres per town

CHAS: Charles River dummy variable (1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)

RM: Average number of rooms per dwelling

AGE: Proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940

DIS: Weighted distances to five Boston employment centers

RAD: Index of accessibility to radial highways

TAX: Full-value property tax rate per $10,000

PTRATIO: Pupil-teacher ratio by town

B: 1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of Black people by town

LSTAT: Lower status of the population

MEDV: Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000s (target variable)

Requirements
Python 3.x

NumPy

Pandas

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib

Jupyter Notebook (optional for interactive exploration)

Installation
Clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/house-price-prediction.git
cd house-price-prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Explore the data: Understand the dataset and its features.

Preprocess the data: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize numerical features.

Train the model: Fit a linear regression model to the training data.

Evaluate the model: Assess the performance of the model on the test data.

Predict house prices: Use the trained model to make predictions on new data.

Run the following command to start the project:

bash
python main.py
Model Training
The model training process involves the following steps:

Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the data for training.

Feature Selection: Select relevant features for the model.

Model Training: Train a linear regression model on the training data.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize the model parameters (if applicable).

Evaluation
Evaluate the model using various metrics, such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (R2) score.

python
from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error, mean_squared_error, r2_score

# Predictions on test data
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluation metrics
mae = mean_absolute_error(y_test, y_pred)
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
r2 = r2_score(y_test, y_pred)

print(f"Mean Absolute Error: {mae}")
print(f"Mean Squared Error: {mse}")
print(f"R-squared: {r2}")
Results
Summarize the results of the model training and evaluation, including key performance metrics and visualizations of the predictions.
