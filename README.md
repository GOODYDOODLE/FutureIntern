## Overview
This project demonstrates how to use linear regression for predicting house prices based on input features such as size, number of rooms, location, etc. The goal is to help understand the correlation between these features and house prices, as well as provide a baseline model for price prediction.

---

## Features
- **Data preprocessing**: Handles missing values and scales the data for optimal model performance.
- **Feature selection**: Identifies the most important features for accurate predictions.
- **Linear regression model**: Implements a simple, interpretable model.
- **Evaluation metrics**: Calculates RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) and R^2 score to evaluate model performance.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/house-price-prediction.git
   cd house-price-prediction
   ```

2. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## Usage

1. Place your dataset in the `data/` directory and update the `data_path` variable in the code.

2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python house_price_prediction.py
   ```

3. View the results, including evaluation metrics and visualizations of predicted vs. actual prices.

---

## Dataset
The project uses a sample dataset for house prices (e.g., `data/house_prices.csv`). This dataset contains features like:
- Size of the house (in square feet)
- Number of bedrooms and bathrooms
- Location
- Year built

You can replace this dataset with your own for custom predictions.

---

## Results
The model achieves the following metrics:
- **RMSE**: 20000 (example)
- **R^2 score**: 0.85 (example)

Example visualization:
- Predicted vs. actual prices plot.
- Feature importance chart.
